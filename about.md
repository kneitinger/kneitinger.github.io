Born in Buffalo, NY and growing up in a small rural community 40 miles south of
it, I am currently a student at Portland State University, majoring in Computer
Science and minoring in Mathematics. I am focusing my studies around audio
synthesis, sound control interfaces, music creation software, and operating systems.

In my free time I like to play music, tinker with Linux and FreeBSD,
create DSP instruments/effects, 
and play with the fine dogs that my partner and I care for.
