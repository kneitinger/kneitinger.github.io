This page is a collection of articles for projects I work on, things I learn, and workflows I find helpful.

I am an ops engineer by title and developer of open source software in my free time.  I enjoy
working on software synthesizers/audio tools, operating systems, *nix utilities, and cloud-free home
automation electronics.

I currently reside in Portland, OR in a swell communal house with, among other folks,
my partner and our wonderful dogs.
