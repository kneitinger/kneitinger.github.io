Originally from Western New York, I am currently a student at Portland State University majoring in Computer
Science. I am focusing my studies around audio
synthesis, sound control interfaces, music creation software, and operating systems.

In my free time I like to play music, tinker with operating systems,
create DSP instruments/effects, 
and play with the fine dogs that my partner and I care for!
