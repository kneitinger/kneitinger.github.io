I am currently a student at Portland State University, majoring in Computer
Science and minoring in Mathematics. I am focusing my studies around audio
synthesis, sound control interfaces, music creation software, and operating systems.
I

 planning on attending Stanford's Center for
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) in 2017.


 Informally, I am a
lifelong autodidact, focusing my studies on electronic musical instrument and
interface design (hardware and software), computer programming, \*nix
administration, woodworking, small-scale farming and physics throughtout the
years.
